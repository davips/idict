# The operator '^' indicates a relevant point during the process, i.e., a point where data should be stored.
# It is mostly intended to avoid costly recalculations or log results.
# The symbol points upwards, meaning data can momentarily come from or go outside of the process.
# When the same process is repeated, only the first request will trigger calculation.
# Local caching objects (dicts or dict-like database servers) can also be used.
# They should be wrapped by square brackets to avoid ambiguity.
# The list may contain many different caches, e.g.: [RAM, local, remote].
